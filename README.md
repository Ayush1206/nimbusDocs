# NimbusDocs

**NimbusDocs** is an intuitive API documentation tool inspired by Swagger, designed to make API exploration easier without complicated setups. Simply upload a JSON file that describes your API, and NimbusDocs will generate a detailed, interactive API documentation page, similar to Swagger UI.

### Features
- **Multi-Language Support**: Works seamlessly with APIs in multiple languages, such as PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby on Rails, etc.
- **Simple Setup**: No complex configuration is requiredâ€”just download the project, run it, and upload your JSON files.
- **Interactive API Testing**: Allows you to run your API endpoints and view responses directly in the UI, similar to Postman or Swagger.
- **File Upload for Documentation**: Simply upload a JSON file, and NimbusDocs will automatically generate API documentation for you.
- **Gradient Method Colors**: Visual representation of HTTP methods with unique gradient styles for better clarity.
- **Reset Functionality**: Easily reset your uploaded JSON file to make new API entries.
